# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Jano Ticketing System. We are a
very tiny team and so rely on the help of the community to make improvements which
we wouldn't otherwise have time to make!

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Read through this Guide and our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and make
  sure that you're happy with them
* Look through the list of
  [outstanding issues](https://github.com/jano-may-ball/ticketing/issues), or 
  [create a new issue](https://github.com/jano-may-ball/ticketing/issues/new) if it
  has not already been reported
* Assign the issue to yourself so everyone knows that you're working on it
* Fork this repository and create a new branch (e.g. `bug-42`) 
* Start working!

## Making and Submitting Changes

* Make sure that you follows the [PSR-2 Coding Style](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
  and make regular commits detailing changes made
* Write tests where possible and be sure to test non-trivial changes on a test server!
* When done, push the commits to your fork
* If you haven't already, sign our Contributor License Agreement
* [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/jano-may-ball/ticketing/compare): we may
  then need to discuss some of the changes with you but hopefully after that we will
  merge your changes into the repository!
