# Security

The Jano Ticketing System maintainers take security very seriously. We welcome any peer review of open source code to
 ensure nobody's system is ever compromised or hacked.

## Where should I report security issues?

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately.
 Please use our vulnerability disclosure program at [Hacker One](https://hackerone.com/jano_may_ball) to provide details and reproduction steps and we will respond
  ASAP. If you prefer not to use Hacker One, email us directly at `security@janoticketing.co.uk` with details and reproduction steps. Security issues **always** take precedence over bug fixes and feature work. We can and do mark releases as "urgent" if they contain serious security fixes.
