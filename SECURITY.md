# Security

The Jano Ticketing System maintainers take security very seriously. We welcome any peer review of open source code to
 ensure nobody's system is ever compromised or hacked.

## Where should I report security issues?

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately.
 Please email us directly at `security@janoticketing.co.uk` with details and reproduction steps. We aim to 
 acknowledge all reports within 3 business days, and confirm any vulnerability present within 28 business days.
  
For more serious issues, you may encrypt your message using our PGP key with the fingerprint `D497 FB0F E525 E821 B3D3 0BD1 3051 F368 F96A 5D1C`. In such case 
 please attach your own PGP public key so that any further email exchanges can be encrypted.
 
Security issues **always** take precedence over bug fixes and feature work. We can and do mark releases as "urgent" if they contain serious security fixes.
